# Research-Paper-On-SERS
This is a research paper for Speech Emotion Recognition System in which there step by step process for making a efficient SERS model and there is comparison between various different machine learning models which are suitable for making a good SERS.
In this brief research paper I have done comparison between good and efficient machine learning and deep learning models like Support Vector Machine(SVM), Multivariate Linear Regression(MLR) and Recurrent Neaural Network(RNN). 
And the conclusion after my research was that - RNN often perform better with more data and it suffers from the problem of very long training times. Therefore, we concluded that the SVM and MLR models have a good potential for practical usage for limited data in comparison with RNN .
